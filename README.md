# AI-prompts
Miscellaneous assortment of AI prompts I regularly use. Primary focus is on copyediting and working with LaTeX output for manuscripts. Links for specific prompts with a brief description included below. 

 - [`manuscript-copyedits`](https://github.com/mackaytc/AI-prompts/blob/main/manuscript-copyedits) I use this prompt when I want to copyedit a specific paragraph, section, etc. and check for consistency in references across a longer manuscript, and I want to provide the full manuscript as context.
   - In general, giving an LLM a 30-40 page PDF manuscript and saying, "copyedit this" can be kind of hit or miss. It will often focus on random sections, miss obvious issues, etc. This approach is a way of including the overall manuscript as context while focusing the LLM on what you really care about.
   - If all you really care about is a simple copyediting (i.e., you don't want it to check calculations or section references), its easier to just provide the specific text you want copyedited sans text.
